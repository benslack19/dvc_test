This repo contains code for the project for learning DVC.

I'm following the [Get Started](https://dvc.org/doc/start) documentation and will write notes as I go along.

6/21/21:
- Evaluate adding coding snippet to track plots.
    - Edited `featurization.py` to add code to make one random plot, did `dvc run -f` and git committed.
    - Altered code generating plot, did `dvc run -f` again and git committed.
    - Go back to the first code-generating plot.
